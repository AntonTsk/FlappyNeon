# FlappyNeon

Android Game "Flappy Neon" made with Unity Engine. 
Unity was chosen as the game engine, as it is a powerful cross-platform game engine and it supports C # scripting.

Game is available:

To develop the game, I took the Unity Starting course on Unity Learn.
During the development process, I learned the basics of developing games on unity, faced with problems of optimization and product testing.

Unity C# Scripting:
I pretty easily mastered scripting in a Unity with my knowledge of C # and object-oriented programming. But it is worth recognizing that the unity library adds a lot of functions to C #. Unity's official documentation helped me learn the library.

Game Graphics:
Background Sprites for the game I downloaded from Unity Asset Store and remade it for my game in Adobe Photoshop. And also UI elements are made in Photoshop from scratch.
It was a good experience. I plunged into the world of game development, learned the features of game development.

The creation process will be explained on my YouTube Channel  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbaKHp8FCfmidHy8GoBM7nQ/featured
